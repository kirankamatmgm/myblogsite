## [Flower Image Classifier](https://github.com/kirankamatmgm/FlowerImageClassifier)

A 102 category dataset consisting of 102 flower categories, commonly occuring in the United Kingdom. Each class consists of 40 to 258 images. The images have large scale, pose and light variations.\
I have used fastai library and pytorch for this project.\
I got accuracy of 97.84%\

## [Steering Wheel Angle Prediction](https://github.com/kirankamatmgm/steering-wheel-prediction)

This my engineering final year major project along with 3 other team mates.
We have published paper in International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology (IRJET) Volume 7, Issue 3, March 2020 S.NO: 924 [Our published paper](https://www.irjet.net/archives/V7/i3/IRJET-V7I3924.pdf)\
We have successfully shown that CNNs are able to
understand the entire learning process lane and road
following without manual decomposition into road or lane
marking detection, path planning, and control.\
A small amount of training data from less hours of driving was
sufficient to train the virtual car to operate in diverse
conditions, on highways, local and residential roads in
sunny, cloudy, and rainy conditions\[4]. The CNN is able to
extract the meaningful and useful road features from a
very sparse training signal(only steering).

## [Survival Estimates lymphoma patients](https://github.com/kirankamatmgm/Surivival-estimates-of-lymphoma-patients)

This is Survival Estimates that Vary with Time.\
Analyze surivival estimates for a dataset of lymphoma patients considering Censored Data and Kaplan-Meier Estimates\

## [Dog vs Cat breed classifier](https://github.com/kirankamatmgm/DogandCatBreed_Classifier#dog-vs-cat-breed-classifier)

I used the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset by O. M. Parkhi et al., 2012 which features 12 cat breeds and 25 dogs breeds. My model will need to learn to differentiate between these 37 distinct categories.\
I got accuracy of 94% which is just 6% error with just few lines of code, when compared to state of art model in 2012 paper which had 56% accuracy.\

## [Estimating Treatment Effect](https://github.com/kirankamatmgm/Estimating-Treatment-Effect)
Evaluating Treatment Effect Models  
Comparing predicted and empirical risk reductions, Computing C-statistic-for-benefit
Interpreting ML models for Treatment Effect Estimation  
Implement T-learner


## [Risk score model for Diabetic Retinopathy](https://github.com/kirankamatmgm/Risk-score-model-for-Diabetic-Retinopathy)
Building a risk score model for retinopathy in diabetes patients using logistic regression.


## [Stochastic Gradient Descent](https://github.com/kirankamatmgm/Basics-of-SGD-and-build-from-scratch)
This project is basically building SGD from scratch by learning all basics need to know.\
Even though we have high level api to do all the functions for us, still it is important to learn few important(if not all) concepts.\
SGD taking each step is shown using animation.  



## [House price prediction](https://github.com/kirankamatmgm/House-price-prediction-different-approches)
I have solved Kaggle problem House price regression using 2 methods.  

* First method\
  Traditional and most important way of solving, Apply machine learning techniques like preprocessing and all other feature engineering steps. And then applied random forest and also tried xgboost  
* Second method
  apply neural network to solve problem. for this I tried fastai library


## [Comment Classification problem](https://github.com/kirankamatmgm/Comment-Classification-problem/blob/master/CommentClassifier.ipynb)
solved using fastai library
