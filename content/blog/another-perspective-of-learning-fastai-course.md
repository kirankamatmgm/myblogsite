## My experience with fastai

I have completed fastai part1(2019) part2. So I want to express how fastai helped me to learn fast and share my experiences with the library.

**This is just my experience and what I feel about the course. So don't get me wrong, I am not discouraging anyone. But my true intention to inspire everyone to learn from fast.ai course and whatever may come your way, Just complete the course.**

\
My **glimpses** of fastai courses come 1 year ago when a friend suggested me fastai course. I first went through a few lessons after lesson 3 everything went above my understanding. Because I was used to the university bottom-up approach and went to learn how every line of code works in first attempt. Jeremy had warned to follow his words carefully. I missed on that. I want to summarise the mistakes that I had made when getting started so that hopefully, you will avoid making the same when doing fast.ai

After my first attempt, I left that fastai course and started to learn from other Coursera courses. Until 7 months back when I wanted to build some working model on my own, I was able to do a very basic model and it was far away compared to the state of art results. At this point, I could remember the words of Jeremy "build state of art model" and wanted to explore the top-down approach. Surprisingly top-down approach suites me better than bottom-up. And this time I wanted to complete fastai course, finish what I had left uncompleted.

Since now I had the experience of going through boring, theoretical courses, fastai seemed more interesting, and Jeremy's humor was the best part of his courses. Even though I realized this was the best course on the internet and went through it I was stuck again after lesson 4. But this time I did not want to leave the course.\
So I went through forum and every blog on the internet to know how to complete fastai course. Then I finally realized the way to complete and understand fastai course is just complete **the way Jeremy tells to do it**. 

Haha, I know this seems confusing, but let me explain. When Jeremy tells we will learn in further lessons means just that, don't break your head on that concept and be in the mindset of learning everything on day 1. Believe and you will understand that in future lessons. You surely won't understand in the first attempt( at least I didn't) but after watching it, 4 to 5 times, maybe you will. But we are all so stuck that we usually want to learn every line of code(which is not bad but didn't work for me), we just forget to listen to Jeremy's words. So the best way to complete the course is to surrender your mind to Jeremy and **listen to every word what he tells, and just follow it**. 

So what next after you complete course. Don't worry, there is another part. And this repeats every year, 2 parts of the course and with 6 months gap in between. 

6 Months!!! Don't worry, you need that time to digest the content of the course and explore all techniques on a new dataset. 

My suggestions:

Try another beginner friendly Python MOOC.

## Perspective

Recently when I was watching part 2 of course for 3rd time, I had a new perspective of looking at fastai course.

I have gone through part1 of course nearly 6times and part2 of course 3 times(currently learning part2). All the words like epochs, learning rate, momentum, fit-one-cycle found like these apply to not just to a dataset but also a way of learning fastai course.

Consider epochs as a number of times you need to watch and learn from fastai course.

Learning rate as a factor to learn the course. Discriminate learning rate may be treated as when you start the course you take small steps, and as you feel comfortable you take larger steps and as concept becomes difficult you take small steps.

Momentum: after you complete the course once, you cover easy concepts of the course faster.

fit one cycle as complete course fully once and repeat for required epochs.

weights may be you understanding with deep learning concepts before you start course either random or zero or even pretrained if you have done other awesome courses.

As you learn the course you weights gets changed from backpropogation. As we fully understand the course we get better accuracy. 

Just this is not enough augmentation, dropout is also required to increase your understanding i.e. accuracy. 

dropout can be treated as highly tough or things you dont want to get into in the beginning are drop out in first iteration and after few epoches approch it(even though it is not exactly dropout)

Augmentation can be treated as learning same concepts in lessons on different datasets.
