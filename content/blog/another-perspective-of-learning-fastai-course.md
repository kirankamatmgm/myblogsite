## My experience with fastai

I have completed fastai part1(2019) part2. So I want to express how fastai helped me to learn fast and share my experiences with the library.

I had written this post long ago and wanted to publish during the release of fastai2, so that it might help new students joining the course. I welcome everyone who are starting the course to fastai family.

**This is just my experience and what I feel about the course. So don't get me wrong, I am not discouraging anyone. But my true intention is to inspire everyone to learn from fast.ai course and whatever may come your way, Just complete the course.**

\
My **glimpses** of fastai courses come 1 year ago when a friend suggested me fastai course. I first went through a few lessons after lesson 3 everything went above my understanding. Because I was used to the university bottom-up approach and went to learn how every line of code works in the first attempt. Jeremy had warned to follow his words carefully. I missed on that. I want to summarise the mistakes that I had made when getting started so that hopefully, you will avoid making the same when doing fast.ai

After my first attempt, I left that fastai course feeling it's difficulty and started to learn from other Coursera courses. Until 7 months back when I wanted to build some working model on my own, I was able to do a very basic model and it was far away compared to the state of art results. At this point, I could remember the words of Jeremy "build state of art model" and wanted to explore the top-down approach. Surprisingly top-down approach suites me better than bottom-up. And this time I wanted to complete fastai course, finish what I had left uncompleted.

Since now I had the experience of going through boring, theoretical courses, fastai seemed more interesting, and Jeremy's humor was the best part of his courses. Even though I realized this was the best course on the internet and went through it, I was stuck again after lesson 4. But this time I did not want to leave the course.\
So I went through forum and every blog on the internet to know how to complete fastai course. Then I finally realized the way to complete and understand fastai course is just complete **the way Jeremy tells to do it**. 

Haha, I know this seems confusing, but let me explain. When Jeremy tells we will learn in further lessons means just that, don't break your head on that concept and be in the mindset of learning everything on day 1. Believe and you will understand that in future lessons. You surely won't understand in the first attempt( at least I didn't) but after watching it, 4 to 5 times, maybe you will. But we are all so stuck that we usually want to learn every line of code(which is not bad but didn't work for me), we just forget to listen to Jeremy's words. So the best way to complete the course is to surrender your mind to Jeremy and **listen to every word what he tells, and just follow it**. 

So what next after you complete course. Don't worry, there is another part. And this repeats every year, 2 parts of the course and with 6 months gap in between. 

6 Months!!! Don't worry, you need that time to digest the content of the course and explore all techniques on a new dataset. 

## My suggestions:

* surrender your mind to Jeremy and listen to every word what he tells, and just follow it.
* People will suggest you and you may also feel to try another beginner-friendly course, but don't quit fastai course, be persistent and finish what you started.
* People may tell you, need to be able to read a lot of papers, it's correct. But the approach matters. At first, read what you can in the paper. convert math to code. And as you go you will get better.
* Watching the lectures DOES NOT EQUATE TO DOING Deep learning. So write all code in the lesson, try to apply on a different kind of dataset.
* At first, when you start, watch the lecture once. It's okay, you won’t understand everything, you don’t have to either. But the important thing is complete.
* Code as much as you can.



## Perspective

Recently when I was watching part 2 of course for 3rd time, I had a new perspective of looking at fastai course.

I have gone through part1 of course nearly 5times and part2 of course 3 times(currently learning part2). All the words like epochs, learning rate, momentum, fit-one-cycle found like these apply to not just to a dataset but also a way of learning fastai course.

Consider **epochs** as a number of times you need to watch and learn from fastai course.

**Learning rate** as a factor to learn the course. **Discriminative learning rate** may be treated as when you start the course you take small steps, and as you feel comfortable you take larger steps and as the concept becomes difficult you take small steps.

**Momentum**: after you complete the course once, you cover easy concepts of the course faster.

**fit one cycle** as complete course fully once and repeat for required epochs.

**weights** maybe you understanding with deep learning concepts before you start course either random or zero or even pre-trained if you have done other awesome courses.

As you learn the course you weights get changed from **backpropagation**. As we fully understand the course we get better accuracy. 

Augmentation, dropout is also required to increase your understanding i.e. accuracy. 

**dropout** can be treated as highly tough or things you don't want to get into in the beginning are drop out in the first iteration and after few epochs approach it(even though it is not exactly dropout)

**Augmentation** can be treated as learning the same concepts in lessons on different datasets.

**I did not know how to connect concepts of the loss function, optimizer and most importantly the help from forums into this crazy perspective. If you can help me connect dots I would be grateful.**

I would love to hear feedback, your perspective. You can tweet [@UKamath7](https://twitter.com/UKamath7) or comment on kaggle, reddit or medium.
