We have all used Object-Oriented Programming knowingly or otherwise. If you are gathering skills to be a data scientist then OOP is also important topic to learn. 

Have you wondered how famous packages which we use like scikit-learn works???(how it is built)

What does it mean when we use import pandas as pd pd.read_csv()

You actually use concepts of OOPs So let's get started

Welcome!!!

Object-oriented programming is style of writing programs using classes and objects.

object-oriented programming allows you to create large, modular programs that can easily expand over time;

object-oriented programs hide the implementation from the end-user. When you train a machine learning algorithm with Scikit-learn, you don't have to know anything about how the algorithms work or how they were coded. You can focus directly on the modeling. If the implementation changes, you as a user of package might not ever find out.

Objects are defined by attributes and methods.

Think objects as things that exist in the real world.

For example, If we take Restaurant

Restaurant is itself object 

food dishes is object

waiter is also object
