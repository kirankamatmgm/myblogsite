title: How to build Gatsby blog with Netlify CMS
description: Complete guild to build Gatsby blog with Netlify CMS
---
I have followed instruction from Thomas Wang. I have tried to explain in detail all difficulties and solution in building this site.

This tutorial will use [gatsby-personal-starter-blog](http://t.wang.sh/gatsby-personal-starter-blog), a Gatsby starter based on the official [gatsby-starter-blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/). The differences are that gatsby-personal-starter-blog is configured to run the blog on a subdirectory, /blog, and comes pre-installed with [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) for content editing. It also adds VS Code highlighting for code blocks.
