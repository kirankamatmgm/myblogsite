# 1. My experience with fastai #

My experience is with fastai course part1 2019

My **glimpses** of fastai courses come 1 year ago, when friend suggested me fastai course telling you would really fast get into deep learning. I first went through lesson 1 and everything went out of head. Because I was used to university bottom up approach and went to learn how every line of code works in first attempt. 
Then I left that fastai course and started to learn from other coursera courses. Until 3 months back when I wanted to build some working model on my own I couldn't. Then I realized may be top down approach suites me better than bottom up. And once again luckly I saw fastai course and started to learn from Jeremy's videos.

Since I had experience of going through boring, in depth, theoratical, not so useful courses(from most trending platform) before fastai seemed more interesting, and Jeremy's humour was best part of his courses. Even though I realized this was best course in the internet and went through it I was stuck again after lesson 4. 

Then I went through forum and every blog to know how to complete fastai course. Then I finally realized the way to complete and understand fastai course is just complete the way Jeremy tell to do it. Haha, I know this seems confusing, but let me explain. When Jeremy tells we will learn in further lessons means just that, dont break your head on that concept and you will understand in future lessons. You surely wont understand in first attempt but after watching it after 4 to 5 times, may be you will. But we are all so stuck that we usually want to learn every line of code(which is not bad, but didnt work for me), we just forget to listen to Jeremy's words. So the best way to complete course is to surender your mind to Jeremy and listen every word what he tells, and just follow it.

# 2. My Perspective #

Recently I had a new perspective of fastai course....
(epoches,learning rate, momentum, fitonecycle, cnn_learner, pytorch(from forum))

epoches - number of times you go through lesson

dropout - highly tough or things you dont want to get into leave in the beginning and after few epoches approch it(even though not exactly dropout)
