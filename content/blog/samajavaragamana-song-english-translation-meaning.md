This is just quarantine things, and main benifit of having your own blogsite



My eyes are hooked on to your legs

Don't step on my gaze, show some mercy



My dreams will guard your eyes like kohl

You set me on fire when you rub your rosy cheeks

Your tresses fly as my breath whistles in the air

Don't get cranky and push me away



Sweetheart! I can't help but  fall for you

You know your heart sways to the youth's beat



You're like the cool breeze spilling fragrances of jasmine

You're like the land shimmering with moonlight

You're like peacock dancing in a garden of flowers

I can't begin to describe your elegance in words



I caress you like a shadow that chases you

Yet, you  don't react the slightest, girl

I realize you're not the girl who falls for trickery

Pay heed to this sweet plea that makes my heart pound
