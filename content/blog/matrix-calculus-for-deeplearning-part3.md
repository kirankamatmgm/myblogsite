  This is last part of blog, which explains The gradient of the neural network
  activation and loss function, and wind up blog

We have looked into Jacobian matrix, element wise operation, derivatives involving single expressions and vector sum reduction and chain rule in previous blog. Please through that, [Blog 1](https://kirankamath.netlify.app/blog/matrix-calculus-for-deeplearning-part1/), [Blog 2](https://kirankamath.netlify.app/blog/matrix-calculus-for-deeplearning-part2/).
