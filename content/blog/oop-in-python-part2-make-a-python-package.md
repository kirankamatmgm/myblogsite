In [part 1](https://kirankamath.netlify.app/blog/object-oriented-programming-in-python-part1/) of the blog we have seen what is object-oriented programming and even learned a few important concepts like magic methods and inheritance. In this blog we **will** see 



We will see how to organise python code into modules.

what is module?? a module is a file consisting of Python code. A module can define functions, classes and variables.  Grouping related code into a module makes the code easier to understand and use. They are called modules, because these are modular, which means we can reuse these files in different applications. 



Package is collection of modules placed into directory. Python package needs an \_\_init\_\_.py file. how to create this \_\_init\_\_.py file and then pip install the package into your local Python installation

What is pip?

Pip is a Python package manager that helps with installing and uninstalling Python packages. You might have used pip to install packages using the command line: pip install numpy. When you execute a command like pip install numpy, pip will download the package from a Python package repository called PyPi.
