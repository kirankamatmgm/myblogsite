  Invention vs Innovation, which is important or more importantly in which we
  all can contribute. I wanted to know about this so writing blog to learn with
  you all.

Inspiration for writing: In recent times people are misusing word invention and innovation, and using it interchangeably. So to know more about the difference I am writing this blog.

“invention” can be defined as the creation of a product or introduction of a process for the first time. “Innovation”  occurs if someone improves on or makes a significant contribution to an existing product, process or service. Innovate: Make changes in something established, especially by introducing new methods, ideas, or products.

Innovation flows from invention. innovations are usually based on some invention

**change** Consider the microprocessor. Someone invented the microprocessor. But by itself, the microprocessor was nothing more than another piece on the circuit board. It’s what was done with that piece — the hundreds of thousands of products, processes and services that evolved from the invention of the microprocessor — that required innovation. Innovations are therefore the most demanding works

"Novelty: Something new

Creation: Something new and valuable

Invention: Something new, having potential value through utility

Innovation: Something new and uniquely useful" by Horace Dediu

invention is said to be creation of new things. The smartphone, the car, the desktop computer these are inventions. Innovation is the continual upgrade of inventions.

If you consider sending messages as invention then Whatsapp is innovation. And if you consider Whatsapp an invention then all features you get with each upgrade is innovation. There's no clear and obvious dividing line between the two but that's fine.

Consider example of Apple's iPhone. We can treat iPhone as obviously, at first, an invention and the subsequent upgrades to it are innovation. But according to Tim Worstall, the iPhone itself was both invention and innovation, yes, because it is in part derivative of other earlier technologies. Apple didn't invent GPS for example, but incorporating it into a phone is innovation, not invention.

Example of drone.

Innovating isn't the same as inventing.   Inventing is creating something that hasn't existed before, while innovating is changing or combining things - usually for commercial benefit.

Invention without innovation can just create toys.  You may fulfil a personal desire to build, but may not deliver a return on the investment of time and resources.

Edison didn't invent the lightbulb

Though he is often (falsely) credited for inventing the lightbulb(https://www.bulbs.com/learning/history.aspx) , Thomas Edison did not create it.  What he did was improve it significantly and make it commercially viable.  His lightbulb was an innovation. 

There were up to 20 inventors who created an incandescent lamp before Edison; but his was much, much better.  It was widely adopted and became the lightbulb - also making it too hard for the others to compete with.

Game-changing products are often innovations not inventions

Apple have made products that have owned and even defined their category. But they invented less and combined inventions to innovate new products. This is one of the reasons technology grows at an exponential rate - it builds on previous technology, rather than having to re-invent at every step.  Obviously the inventors need to be properly recognised and rewarded - but the real game changers are the innovators.

Was the iPhone a great invention?  NO. We can dissect the iPhone into individual inventions and evolutionary consolidations of other gadget functions and features. Was the iPhone a great innovation? Absolutely.The iPhone created an ecosystem of media content, telecommunications, licensing, application development, and unified them all under one roof. The iPad grew on that success and created a new “screen” to expand the mobile and personal experience

Today it's easier to innovate than ever before. innovating today is easier than it has ever been, because of the platforms available.

Given the choice to invent or innovate, most entrepreneurs would take the latter. Let’s face it, innovation is just sexier. Perhaps there are a few people who know who invented lens or GPS or LED or the camera. But virtually everyone on the planet knows who Steve Jobs is.

A FINAL THOUGHT

While they tend to be lumped together, “invention” and “innovation” are not the same thing. There are distinctions between them, and those distinctions are important.

So how do you know if you are inventing or innovating? Consider this analogy:

If invention is lighting a lamp, innovation is the brightness effect that light from lamp causes so that we can see the room. Someone has to light the lamp. That’s the inventor. Someone has to recognize the lamp will eventually light the room. That’s the entrepreneur.

I have not invented this blog, actually, I have read a dictionary and any articles to know the difference and put all together in my style so I have innovated this blog. 

If you have a different view I'd like to hear your comments. You can either tweet or comment on Kaggle or Reddit.
