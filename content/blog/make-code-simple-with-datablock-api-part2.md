\# **Blog15**

This is part two of my series Make code Simple with DataBlock API. If you have not read part one, see [here](https://kirankamath.netlify.app/blog/fastais-datablock-api/). In it, we have seen what DataBlock as a whole means, what are the bricks that are put together to make datablock. In last blog, I had stopped showing code so, in this blog, we'll be diving into code.

Welcome!!!

## Idea

* write same datablock with pytorch and on fastai and compare number of code, and easy ness to make work.
