# What are new year's resolutions?

A New Year's resolution is a tradition, in which a person resolves to continue good practices, change an undesired trait or behavior, to accomplish a personal goal, or improve their life.

New year resolutions are mainly made to improve from where we are. There are famous new year resolutions like get in shape, switch to healthy food style, meet new people and lot more. 

It is also started to leave a bad habit. for example no smoking. Or it can be made to start a good habit like waking up early in the morning.

# Why new year's resolution?

In this we should cover both why required and why most of times it wont work.

## Why required

New year resolutions can become strong motivatinal tool and can helping in developing a skill or start a good habit. But not always this works. If you break or dont follow your resolution it can be demotivating. But to start a  habit new year's resolution can be great boon and helping in tracking progress when designed properly

## Why most of new year's resolutions don't work

According to U.S. News & World Report, the failure rate for New Year's resolutions is said to be about 80 percent, and most lose their resolve by mid-February. If this is true, it's clear that there is nothing wrong with us; the problem is in the tradition itself. Reason may be anything from lack of clarity to setting high expectations. I agree, but I think there's more to it than that. We are unreasonable about resolution. Out of over excitement we may start resolution but it may backfire when we realize resolutions are not practically possible. 



# How to design new year's resolution?

Even though I'm writing this blog my statistics with new year resolution is not good. So I researched a lot to know how other people(specially developers) make and follow resolution. I went through a lot of blogs and I will list out what I found useful. I have not followed any but will implement along with you.

From Quincy Larson blog(mentioned at the end of this blog) I understood  3 important  factors to make successful new year resolution.

1. Relevance: Does those new year resolution mean anything to you? If you love javascript then learning React( understanding difference between other frameworks) is relevant to you. If not then you make drop in between. Close your eyes and think that you have completed your resolution if that brings a smile on your face and boost your excitement then that is mostly relavent resolution you should take up.
2. Accountibility: This is to know if you can really do it. Tell you friends and family about it or post it in twitter, so that you may find yourself accountable
3. support: This is whether you have friends or family who can help you finish resolution and can boost your confidence when you are dull.

Divide resolutions into smaller chunks. Divide into smaller period and complete each so that you are tracking your progress. You can join existing social tags like #100daysofCode from freecodecamp or #100daysofML from siraj raval, or start your own tags.

Make resolution part of your routine. This is can be useful. Like if learning competitive coding is your new year's resolution then, practise it daily 1hr at same time. So that it becomes part of your life. 

I have read in some blog that choosing a WORD for your resolution is also useful.
